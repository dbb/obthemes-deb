# Debian Classic Openbox Themes

Packaged by: dbb(olton)/envyouraudience <github.com/dbb>

Since wheezy (oldstable at the time of writing), Debian no longer provides
the `openbox-themes` package. It may still be downloaded at:

https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/openbox-themes

After two more releases, this package will no longer appear on Debian's
main package site and thus will be more difficult to find. Although many of
the individual themes are already hosted elsewhere, to my knowledge this
whole collection is not. Thus I created this archive to serve as a mirror of
these classic themes.

Author/copyright info can be found in the included `copyright` file.

Debian package info is in `changelog.gz` and `openbox-themes_1.0.2.dsc`.
